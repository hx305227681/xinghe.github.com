###Short Biography
Dr. Xing He (M’19) received the Ph.D. degree from the Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2017. His main research interests include digital twin of energy system, and spatial-temporal data analytics in smart grid.
Dr. He start the relevant research since 2013, and now he is a research associate of Key Laboratory of Control of Power Transmission and Conversion, Ministry of Education of China, and also a research associate of the Research Center for Big Data & AI Engineering Technology in Shanghai Jiao Tong University. 
In the past five years, he published 30 SCI/EI papers, 3 international book chapters, and 3 patents. He is the reviewers of IEEE Journals, e.g. IEEE Transaction on Smart Grid, IEEE Transaction on Power Systems, and is also awarded distinguished reviewer of Power System Technology (EI Journal, Top 3 in the Power System domain in China) twice (2017, 2019). 
In 2020, Dr. HE is the convener and chairman of the 3rd Youth Forum on Energy Innovation (online, with an audience of 10000+), and a Reporter in Panel Session of IEEE PES General Meeting (online). He is also the Guest Editors for special issue on ``Digital twin Technology and its application in Power systems’’ in Power System Technology.
He is now in charge of a National Natural Science Foundation of China (Youth Fund).
